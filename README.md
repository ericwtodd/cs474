Deep Learning Projects - Cancer Detection, Style Transfer, Naive GANs, and a Char RNN

Cancer Detection : Implementation of a U-Net Style architecture for classification of cancerous images in pytorch.

Style Transfer : Pytorch implementation of Style Transfer combining the content of one image and the style of another

Naive GAN : My first attempt at building a GAN to produce images using just the basic minimax loss.

Char RNN : Pytorch implementation of my own GRU and recurrent neural network for character generation.
